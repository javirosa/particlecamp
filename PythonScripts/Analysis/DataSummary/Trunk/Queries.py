Script that generates average pollutant concentration for each metric that we are collecting in the 
range hood experments.  It is important that the experiments table be filled out with the proper
cooking start and end times so that averages can be taken over this interval.  For each table
queried, a csv file is generated that can be imported into Excel or IGOR.
